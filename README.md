# MarvelFun
Example on using SwiftUI and structured concurrency working with https://developer.marvel.com/v1/public/comics. Includes UITests and Unit Tests with http session injection in order to use mocks instead of hitting the wire.

# API Information
Go to https://developer.marvel.com and get your public api and private api keys. Add them to Constants.swift in order to run the application.

Mocks have been added for tests, nothing necessary to execute.
